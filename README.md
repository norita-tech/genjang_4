### Project on Deep learning
This project was done on the CIFAR_10 dataset

## Project: Image Classification with CNNs(Conv2D) using the CIFAR-10 Dataset
# Goal
The goal of this project is to build a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories. 
The aim is to achieve high accuracy while maintaining model efficiency and to demonstrate how Conv2D layers process spatial information in images.

# Motivation for the Project
Image classification is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision and serves as a foundation for more advanced tasks like object detection and segmentation. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset provides a diverse collection of small-sized images, making it an excellent benchmark for beginners (like me and my team mate) to practice and evaluate
image classification algorithms. Using Conv2D layers allows the model to extract spatial features such as edges, patterns, and textures, which are critical for image 
classification tasks.

# Description of the Data
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a dataset often used in machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks. 
It provides a standard, balanced dataset to evaluate the performance of different algorithms and models.

# Theoretical Background:

# Dataset Overview:

# Name:

CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) The CIFAR-10 dataset was introduced by Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and Vinod Nair in their research at the 
University of Toronto.

# Purpose: 
Designed for training machine learning and deep learning models for image recognition.

# Structure:

Contains 60,000 images divided into:
Training Set: 50,000 images.
Test Set: 10,000 images.
Images are color (RGB), 32x32 pixels, and divided into 10 classes.

Classes:
The dataset contains the following 10 classes:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck Each class has 6,000 images.
